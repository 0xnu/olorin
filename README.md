## Telegram Music Sharing Bot

[Olorin](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/yoruba-word-c156a5b85a427c85b7e23dba1c2d8187b7860ad7.html) is an advanced Telegram music bot written in Golang. It allows users (or admins/moderators) to share songs with dynamic emoji reactions and a Twitter profile link for further engagement.

### Key Features

Below are the key features of the bot:

* Music Sharing: Users can share songs in MP3 format. Each shared song has essential metadata like the title, artist, and genre.
* Dynamic Emoji Reactions: The bot provides a set of emojis (üëç, üëé, üî•, ü•∞, üöÄ) that users can tap to react to the shared song. The count of each emoji reaction updates in real time.
* User Choice Memory: The bot remembers the last emoji each user tapped. If a user changes their reaction, the bot updates the counts accordingly, ensuring that each user's reaction is unique at any given time.
* Twitter Profile Link: Each shared song includes A Twitter profile link. It allows users to follow the source or artist for more updates. The link is formatted to prevent Telegram from showing a web preview card, ensuring a clean and focused user interface.
* Command Deletion: When a user shares song using the `/sharemusic` command, the bot deletes the command message to keep the chat clutter-free.
* Concurrency-Safe: The application uses mutex locks to ensure that the emoji counts are updated atomically, making it safe for use in high-traffic groups.
* Debugging Enabled: The bot runs in debug mode, logging essential information for monitoring and troubleshooting.
